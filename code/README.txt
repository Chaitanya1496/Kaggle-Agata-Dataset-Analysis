THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
  1. Please create a new folder 'code' and paste all the files in that folder.
  2. Ensure all the necessary libraries and modules are installed.
  3. (optional) Firstly, run the file 'Agata_Retail_Clean_Data.py' file.
     The file replaces semicolons with commas, and commas with decimals.
     You can obviously use the different attributes provided by the Pandas library for the same, but I prefer to convert it for my convinience.
